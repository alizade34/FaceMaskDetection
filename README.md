# Facial Mask Detection Project

## Overview
In the wake of global health concerns, the ability to automatically detect facial mask usage in public spaces has become more crucial than ever. This project leverages cutting-edge image processing techniques to discern between individuals wearing masks correctly, incorrectly, or not at all. Utilizing Python, OpenCV, and machine learning algorithms, we aim to contribute to safer public health practices through technology.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before diving into the mask detection project, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV for image processing
- NumPy for numerical calculations
- scikit-learn for machine learning operations

Install all necessary Python packages with this simple command:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn
```

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:
```bash
git clone [repository URL]
```
Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd [project name]
```

## How to Use
This project is structured to be as straightforward as possible:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Place your images in the `dataset/images` directory and annotations in `dataset/annotations`. Ensure annotations are in XML format and adhere to the parsing logic in the script.
2. **Execute the Script**: Run the main script to process the images, perform feature extraction, and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction, preparing the data for model training.

A snippet to get you started with loading images and labels:
```python
images, labels = load_images_and_labels('dataset/images', 'dataset/annotations', (64, 64))
```
